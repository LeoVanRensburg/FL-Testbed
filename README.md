# Federated Learning Testbed

**This project uses CORE to develop a Testbed in which researchers and developers can identify and address weaknesses in current and upcoming Federated Learning algorithms before deploying them in the real world.**

### Overview
This project focuses on the development of a testbed for evaluating Federated Learning (FL) under various conditions of unreliable communication, particularly within low-power IoT ecosystems. The testbed will utilize the Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) to simulate heterogeneous physical devices communicating via wireless channels, allowing for the adjustment of network conditions such as bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss. This setup aims to provide a realistic environment for assessing the performance of FL algorithms under conditions that closely mimic real-world scenarios.

### Signifigance
With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), there is a growing need to train ML models efficiently while preserving user privacy. Federated Learning addresses this need by allowing data to remain local to each device during training. However, the unreliable nature of wireless communications poses significant challenges that are not fully understood due to the limitations of current simulation methodologies. This project seeks to bridge that gap by developing a comprehensive testbed that simulates real-world network conditions, providing valuable insights into the impact of network reliability on FL performance.
